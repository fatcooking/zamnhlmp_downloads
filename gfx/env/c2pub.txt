c2p.zip:  C2pub -  Environment map for Quake2, Half-life and Sin  
by Murray Christian  (contact: fluxion@ii.net)

Created in Bryce4 
released August 23rd, 1999
  

This is the public version of the sky from 'Midday at C-plex City' (ccity2).
A map for Action Half-life.
Basically I took all the buildings I made for that sky, rearranged them 
to make it more generic and re-rendered it.
This kind of sky works a lot better if it is custom made for the map, but this one
should be ok for most uses.  It works best if the map doesn't allow the sky to be
seen too far below its horizon. (that's a free tip btw)

What you don't get:
in the original version the clouds were prettied up a bit, made less Bryce looking
and a few other touch-up things.

Instructions: Quake2 uses both versions of the sky;  Half-life and Sin only 
need the .tga files.
for placement and use of these files check Primordial Soup's procedure.

and check out Darc's own lovely skies while you're at it.



Agreement stuff:
If you do anything with this sky, please tell me about it and keep this .txt file with it.
This sky is free for use by mappers or anyone else not trying to make a profit from it.
If you're not sure, drop me a line. (you might be surprised how agreeable people can be).

sorry about how crappy it looks in software; the Q2 palette needs more blues or something
..next,  a night time version of this sky.

enjoy
